# Step Detection - Flutter (Under Development)

## Overview

This Flutter app is designed to detect and count steps using accelerometer data. The app also visualizes the sensor data in a readable format by applying data downsampling techniques.

## Features

- **Step Counting**: Detects steps by identifying spikes in the accelerometer's Z-axis (az) based on a threshold.
- **Data Visualization**: Downsamples sensor data by segmenting it into equal parts and averaging values for improved readability.
- **Lightweight Backend Data**: Uses a small subset of the original dataset to keep the app lightweight, as the full data science model has not been deployed via an API.
- **Flutter-Based UI**: Interactive charts and tables to display step counts and sensor data trends.

## Approach & Data Visualization

To improve chart readability and manage large amounts of sensor data, the app segments the data into equal parts (e.g., 10 segments). It then:

- Computes the average of sensor values (e.g., az) for each segment.
- Uses the average time of each segment as the X-axis for visualization.

This method ensures a smooth and easily interpretable graphical representation for all users.

## Data Used

The app utilizes precomputed step detection data:

- `calculated_steps.json`
- `input_data.json`

Since the full dataset is large, only a small subset is included to maintain simplicity and efficiency.

## Challenges (With a Touch of Humor)

1. **Setting Up the Environment**: Dealing with compatibility issues... Classic Flutter struggles! ðŸ™ƒ
2. **Package Woes**: Some packages refused to cooperateâ€”especially `data_table_2` and `syncfusion_flutter_datagrid` with different Flutter versions (I must blame my old standard laptop as well ðŸ™ƒ).
3. **Step Counter Logic**: Whatâ€™s easy in Python (import a package and call a function) turned into a monster of a task in Flutter. Appreciation for Python just skyrocketed! ðŸš€
